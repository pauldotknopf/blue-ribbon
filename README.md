# The accident

* I borrowed a truck from my father, a 2020 Toyota Tacoma, for some debris I needed to move.
* I had a piece of wood with a nail sticking out. When I threw it into the back of the truck, it shattered one of the panes into many pieces.

# Contacting companies to repair the broken window.

I began calling multiple companies for quotes to repair the window, including Safelite and Blue Ribbon.

Safelite's quote was cheaper, so I scheduled for them to come out on Jun 2nd.

<details>
  <summary>Initial Safelite quote: $583.12</summary>

</details>

The technician arrived with a non-powered window. I initially scheduled the appointment via their automated website, but unfortunetly, it wasn't smart enough to know that the Tacoma required a *powered* window.

The technician updated the quote to include the correct window.

<details>
  <summary>Final Safelite quote: $1,310.72</summary>

</details>

I declined their new quote because it was more than what Blue Ribbon was offering, $753.90.

I called Blue Ribbon on Jun 2nd to schedule a time to repair the window, which was Jun 3rd.

# Date of the repair

Blue Ribbon (two technicians, technician A and technician B) arrived to replace the window on Jun 3rd. I watched them as they replaced the Window.

*This will become important later.* As I was watching the technicians replace the window, I noticed them having a lot of trouble. They later mentioned the difficulty they were having. It might be because the Truck was brand new with less than 5,000 miles. I witnessed technician B use a 1ft-long pole with an exacto blade at the tip from the outside of the window, as if it were a pry-bar.

After the work was completed, technician A guided me to the truck to sign and pay the invoice. I imediately noticed obvious damage to the truck, which was exactly where I noticed technician B use the 1ft-long pole. After mentioning it politely to the couple, technician B began to get argumentative/defensive. Technician A was quick to diffuse the frustration of technician B, and said the following to me:

> I'm sorry about that. It's our policy to take pictures of existing damages before we begin work, and we didn't, so I will have the owner come out and square up with you.

# The owner, Greg Blum, arriving at my home to "square up".

A few days later, on Jun 5th, Greg Blum arrived at my home to resolve the matter.

We both took a look at the damage. Greg pointed out some smaller notches around the window, which were less noticable. He said to me "this isn't a problem, I have a guy that can fix this, no problem." I was initially planning on holding payment until the damage was resolved, but Greg then said in a persistant/abrasive tone, "I can't float this debt, I need you to pay the invoice." I attempted to compromise, stating "Ok, I will pay the invoice, but only as long as you write on the receipt that you are responsible for the damages, with your signature." He did so.

> Signed statement from Greg: Blue Ribbon to pay to have 2 dents repaired on back of cab passenger side.

With Greg's signed acknowledgement of responsiblity in my hand, I gave Greg the card to process the payment. While the payment was waiting to be confirmed, I casually mentioned to him "You guys give a good price, Safelite wanted to charge me $1,300."

Shortly after Greg left, his guy reached out to me to fix the damages and left a voice mail ([Here](./resources/dent-eraser-voicemail.mp3)).

> Hi Paul, my name is Micky Quin, my company is Dent Eraser, Blue Ribbon Glass gave me a call to take a look at your dents on the roof/back panel of your Toyota Tacoma, give me a call back and we will see if we can get that fixed for you.

I called him back and he asked that I send him pictures of the damage. He then responded, saying "I definately can't repair this, this will need traditional auto-body-shop work. I will let Blue Ribbon know."

> Inspected dents on behalf of Blue Ribbon Glass. I am unable to perform the repairs. Vehicle will need convential auto body repair.

# Trying to follow up with Greg

## The first follow up

After assuming that Dent Eraser would have contacted Greg about the damages, I waited a few days for Greg's call. After hearing nothing, I began calling his office to try to get a hold of him, leaving messages with the office for Greg to get back with me.

After maybe a week, I managed to call the office while Greg was present. Greg was given the phone. The conversation went something like.

> Paul: Hey, the guy you sent out said he can't fix the damages.

> Greg: Well, you wanted all this extra work, entire roof painted, etc, and I'm not doing that.

> Paul: Stop, I didn't demand anything from him. He said simple that he couldn't fix the dents.

> Greg: Well, I got another guy, I'll let you know what's going on when I get a hold of him.

> Paul: Ok, thanks, keep me posted.

## The second follow up

After another week-or-so rolled around, I didn't hear back from Greg. It was really difficult getting a hold of him. I kept leaving messages with his office, no response.

I managed to finally get a hold of him. The conversation went something like.

> Paul: What is going on with your other guy?

> Greg: I sent him a message. I haven't heard back from him. I think he is ducking me.

> Paul: Ok, well, it's been really hard getting a hold of you, and I'm not waiting around forever. I don't mind waiting to see if this new guy gets back with you, but please, keep me in the loop. I don't like going extended periods of time without hearing from you. It worries me.

> Greg: Ok

# Certified letter of intent to involve the courts

After another week-or-so goes by and not hearing anything back, I decided to send Greg a certfied letter. The letter was marked delivered as of June 29th.

<details>

</details>

Key points:

* I got an estimate to repair the damage and attached it to the certified letter. I mentioned that I would accept estimates from Greg, provided that they were from a reputable body shop.
* I made it clear that if this matter isn't solved (or progress made) by a July 3rd, I intend to sue.

# Disputing the charge with bank

Considering that he didn't fulfil his part of the signed contract that "as a part of the $753.90 payment given to the defendent, Blue Ribbon is also to repair the dents," I decided to dispute the charge with the bank.

I provided similar information provided here to the bank.

Greg's response to the claim contained many falsehoods.

> My. Knopf states that our good/services are not as described. We did not install an aftermarket flass in his borrowed truck. We, in fact, installed a factory back flass purchased from Gettel Toyota into the truck. That should clarify the good ends of dispute.

This was never a point of contention. The powered glass itself is fine. However, the seal is broken around the window, because of the damages, causing water to leak behind the window. Ignoring the damage itself to the cabin roof for a moment, I wouldn't consider the window to be "successfuly installed" because of the broken seal caused by the damage to the cabin roof.

> Now as for the services, we service all four local Toyota dealerships and have for over 12 years. We have replaced too many to count back glass in Tacoma pickups oer the years. In fact, we have never had a complaint from any Toyota dealship concerning our work ethic of quality. This is easy to verify as if we did shoddy work as Mr. Knopf is trying to state, the dealerships would not refer Blue Ribbon Auto Glass to it's customers as it would not look professional towards them. They do not want their dealership tarnished by shoddy workmanship.

Assuming that it's true that you've "never had a complaint", there is a first for everything. This doesn't prove you did quality work on my truck. This is a total non-sequitor.

> Mr. Knopf is upset because he he threw debris into his borrowed truck and broke the window, it also dented the track cab. He is very aware of this fact but is trying to get Blue Ribbon to pay for said damages.

This is conjecture. And if this were the case, why did you sign a statement indicating that you are responsible? Why did you instruct your guys to come fix it?

> As a matter of fact, I did tell Mr Knopf that I would agree to have the dents repaied by Dent Dr because it is only $75 charge and it was not worth the trouble not to spend the $75.

You did not. Your signed statement says "Blue Ribbon to pay to have 2 dents repaired on back of cab passenger side." If you truly meant "I will fix the damages, but only up to $75", it would have said so in the statement you wrote and signed. I mean, if your intention was only every to give me $75, why not take that off of the $753.90 bill I paid? Because it didn't happen the way you describe, plain and simple.

> I sent the Dent Dr to Mr Knopf's house that day to do the repair and Mr Knopf ran him off and told him he wanted the repair done at the dealership.

First, the guy you sent was with Dent Earaser, not Dent Dr. I know the conversion I had with him. He was clear in saying that there was absolutely nothing he could do to fix the damages. It was outside of his capability.

Secondly, why would I run someone off who was going to repair the damages? I want nothing more than to see the damages fixed.

Thirdly, Dent Eraser has provided an invoice that clearly states that he is unable to perform the work. Greg is patently lying here.

> I understand that you need to verify his complaint, but it is evident to me that Mr Knopf doesn't want to own up to his responsibilities and wants others to pay for his mistakes.

The complete irony of saying "Mr Knopf doesn't want to own up to his responsibilities and wants others to pay for his mistakes." is completely lost on Greg, when in fact, the exact inverse is true. Greg is desparately running from *his* responsibilities.

All this aside, the bank ultimatly decided in favor of Greg, citing that "the simple act of providing CC is all that is needed to establish that the work was done satisfactory."
